# FruityBot
Tillerino for osu!catch and osu!mania (soon to be for osu!taiko)

I have no idea how to write a README.
Thanks iRevi for the name.


## Set-up
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies: 
   * slider
3. Create a file named "config.py" in the same directory (see config.py.template)
4. Run "bot.py"
