# FruityBot
Tillerino for osu!catch, osu!mania and osu!taiko

I have no idea how to write a README.
Thanks iRevi for the name.


## Set-up
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies: 
   * [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider)
3. Create a file named "config.py" in the same directory (see config.py.template)
4. Run "bot.py"
