# FruityBot
Tillerino for osu!catch and osu!mania (soon to be for osu!taiko)

I have no idea how to write a README.
Thanks iRevi for the name.


## Set-up
1. Download the zip
2. Install the dependencies: 
  * slider
3. Create a file named "config.py" in the same directory and put this in the file:
```python
api_key = ""  # Your osu!api key
password = ""  # Your permanent IRC password
server = "cho.ppy.sh"  # Server
botnick = ""  # Your Username
adminname = ""  # Your Username (same as above)
```
4.  Run "bot.py"
